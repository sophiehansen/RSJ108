Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Build the Necessary Skills and Education.</h3>
              <p>The first thing you should do once you’ve decided to begin a career in music journalism is begin building experience doing the thing you want to do: writing about music. Start writing music reviews, stay current on music related news,read high profile publications, and consider earning a degree in journalism or communications.</p>

              <h3>Gain Experience.</h3>
              <p>Once you have built up your skills, start refining your writing style. You want your writing to say something unique about the music itself. As soon as you’ve begun writing clips, compile them into a portfolio that you can show off to interested parties. Having samples of your work collected in one place makes it easy for prospective employers to assess your style and determine whether you would be a good fit for their publication.When you think your work is good enough to be read by a larger audience, ship it off to the submissions departments of various music news outlets. Tell them a little about yourself and your passion, and be sure to include samples of the clips you’ve worked on.</p>

              <p>Offer your services freelance. You may not get hired on with a reputable publication right away, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still make a living as a music journalist. Keep producing clips and look for places where you can find freelance work. The important thing is to keep your name out there and receive as much exposure as you can. If you are fortunate enough to be offered a job at a music review publication, then you already have one foot in the door. Buckle down and prepare to work your way up the ranks. Be loyal and committed to your team and always make sure that you’re putting out your best work. Your efforts won’t go unnoticed. After you’ve served some time, yours may be one of the names thrown in the hat for a raise or promotion.</p>

As an editor, you’ll have the power to select articles for publication, oversee the work of staff writers and even author special interest pieces on topics of your choosing. Editors also stand to receive many other perks, including free concert admission, backstage passes, advance news and music releases and chances to interview artists.</p>
